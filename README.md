# Meta-Benchmark

**A community standard for measuring AI coding agents on real software development.**

---

## The problem

AI coding agents have gotten dramatically better. But there's no rigorous way to measure it.

Current benchmarks (HumanEval, SWE-bench) measure narrow, atomic tasks designed for models, not agents. They operate at toy scale. They capture nothing developers actually care about: architectural coherence, code quality, knowing what to leave out, performance under load, reliability under failure.

Progress is felt, not measured. "GPT-4 is better at coding now" is a vibe, not a claim.

## The idea

This is the [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/) for AI coding agents.

A standardized application harness defines *what to build* — a fixed canvas. Agents build against it. Their output is scored on dimensions that actually matter. Results are public and reproducible.

> "claude-opus-4-6 built mini-git with 91% functional completeness, survived 87% of adversarial edge cases, 12/14 reliability scenarios, and cost $2.01 in 283 seconds."

That's a precise, reproducible claim. You can verify it. You can compare it. You can beat it.

## The first harness: mini-git

A from-scratch implementation of git — content-addressable object storage, staging index, branches, merges, the works.

**Why mini-git?**
- The spec is git itself. Every developer knows what correct behavior looks like.
- Content-addressable storage (SHA1 blob/tree/commit objects) is non-trivial architecturally — it separates agents that *understand* git from agents that *fake* it.
- Performance and reliability are well-defined and measurable.
- The test suite writes itself.

**Feature tiers:**

| Tier | Weight | Commands |
|------|--------|----------|
| Tier 1 — Core | 40% | `init`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `status` |
| Tier 2 — Branching | 35% | `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`, `diff` |
| Tier 3 — Advanced | 25% | merge conflicts, `reset`, `stash` |

## Scoring

Seven dimensions, all automatable except code quality:

| Dimension | Weight | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Functional completeness | 35%\* | 72 behavioral tests (pytest, black-box) |
| Adversarial survival | 20%\* | 155 edge cases — unicode filenames, binary files, corrupt objects, 100k+ files |
| Extension readiness | 10% | Did the first response include remote operations? (push/pull/fetch tests) |
| Mutation kill rate | 10% | Does the agent's own test suite actually verify its logic? (requires mutmut) |
| Performance | 15% | p95 latency on `git log` (10k commits), `git add` (100k files), `git diff` (1k changes) |
| Reliability | 10% | SIGKILL mid-commit, concurrent writes, disk-full, corrupt object store |
| Code quality | 10% | Multi-model LLM judge, calibrated against human expert scores |

\* *Mutation kill rate weight (10%) is redistributed equally to functional + adversarial when mutation tooling is unavailable.*

**Output:** A structured JSON scorecard + human-readable report. All runs are public.

## Real results

These are actual API calls, actual generated code, actual test runs:

| Model | Score | Functional | Adversarial | Reliability | Cost |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| claude-opus-4-6 | **62.5/100** | 66/72 (91%) | 136/155 (88%) | 12/14 (86%) | $2.01 |
| gemini-2.5-flash | **7.3/100** | 0/72 (0%) | 1/155 (1%) | 0/14 (0%) | $0.02 |

Gemini's 0% functional score isn't an infrastructure failure — its generated code has a struct packing bug that crashes on `git add`. The harness caught a real flaw.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd meta-benchmark
pip install -e .
pip install pytest pytest-timeout pytest-json-report

# Explore what agents are asked to build
cat harnesses/mini-git/prompt.md

# Run the test suite against the included Claude submission
export MINI_GIT_CMD="python submissions/mini-git-claude-opus-4-6-live/workspace/mini_git.py"
python -m pytest harnesses/mini-git/tests/tier1/ -v

# Run a full benchmark against a model (requires API key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # real key from console.anthropic.com
python run_benchmark.py --models claude-opus-4-6 --dry-run

# Score any submission
python -m scorer.scorecard \
  --submission submissions/mini-git-claude-opus-4-6-live \
  --harness mini-git \
  --dry-run

# View the leaderboard
cd leaderboard && python -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## API keys

| Model | Key var | Where to get it |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com → API Keys |
| gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | aistudio.google.com → Get API key |

> **Note:** The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` injected by Claude Code itself is a session token and will return 401 if used for direct API calls. You need a separate key from the Anthropic console.

## Anti-Goodhart measures

Benchmarks rot when they become training targets.

1. **Private held-out tests** — `harnesses/mini-git/tests/held-out/` is gitignored and never published. The adversarial scorer automatically includes these tests when they exist locally. Leaderboard entries scored by a maintainer are marked `verified: true` in the scorecard. Community self-scores run only against public tests. To run held-out tests: clone the repo, add your own tests to that directory, and score.

2. **Harness versioning** — Each harness has a `harness_version` field. When requirements change, the version increments and old scores are not comparable to new ones. The leaderboard filters by version. (Currently v1.0.0 — versioning infrastructure is in place; v2 requirements are not yet written.)

3. **Harness velocity** — The community grows the harness library faster than any model can be fine-tuned against it. One harness is a benchmark. Ten harnesses is a standard.

## Submitting a run

Any agent, any framework. If you can produce code, you can submit.

```bash
# Via the benchmark runner (Claude or Gemini API)
python run_benchmark.py --models claude-opus-4-6

# Manual (Cursor, Devin, Copilot, raw API, etc.)
# → See runner/agents/README.md for the submission format
```

To add your run to the leaderboard, open a PR with your `metadata.json` and `scorecard.json`.

## Contributing harnesses

A harness is a directory under `harnesses/` with:
- `spec.md` — What to build
- `prompt.md` — The seed prompt
- `rubric.md` — Scoring dimensions and weights
- `tests/` — The test suite
- `judge/rubric.md` — LLM judge rubric

Good harness candidates: a compiler for a simple language, a key-value store with persistence, a job queue with retry logic, a diff/patch tool, a CSV query engine. The pattern: **non-trivial, well-specified, testable**.

See [harnesses/mini-git/](harnesses/mini-git/) as the reference implementation.

## The leaderboard

```bash
cd leaderboard && python -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. Sortable by any dimension. Filter by model, framework, harness version. Drill into any run for full scorecard detail.

The leaderboard currently shows two real runs (claude-opus-4-6 and gemini-2.5-flash). Add yours.

*Built to be forked, extended, and argued about. The goal is a common canvas — one place where "this model is better at coding" becomes a falsifiable claim.*
